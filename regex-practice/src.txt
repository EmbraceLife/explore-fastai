#### Issue of not seeing `/notebooks/` with jupyter lab
- [00:00](https://youtu.be/gdsa2VawOeM?t=0) An issue of not able to see `notebooks/`. What does it mean by `not able to see notebooks/`? we are not entering the jupyter lab with `/notebooks/` directory
- [01:53](https://youtu.be/gdsa2VawOeM?t=113) let's see the issue in real time by creating a new notebook/machine with the previous `pre-run.sh` we have.
- [25:45](https://youtu.be/gdsa2VawOeM?t=1545) Now we can see the terminal of this new notebook/machine ![[no-pushd-issue.png]] 
- Does the issue prevent us accessing `/storage/` or `/notebooks/`? No, you can access you from what we see above in Jeremy's notebook
- So what exactly is the problem of the issue? The problem is that even though we can access `/notebooks/` directory but we can't open it with Jupyter lab, and the jupyter lab is stuck with home directory?
- [45:51](https://youtu.be/gdsa2VawOeM?t=2751) After the above issue is dealt with `pushd ~; popd;` in `pre-run.sh`, when we open a new notebook or restart a notebook, jupyter lab open on `/notebooks/` directory and terminal start at `notebooks/` directory
- Why do we want jupyter lab to open `notebooks/` and terminal at `notebooks/`? #question

#### Put terminal programs in background with `ctrl + z`
-   [25:54](https://youtu.be/gdsa2VawOeM?t=1554) <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Why we don't see anything in home directory and nor can we go to</mark> `notebooks/` or `storage/`? because according to `run.sh` (this file is [actually readable](https://youtu.be/gdsa2VawOeM?t=1662) to me after I finished walkthru 6), the `pre-run.sh` file is executed when it is in the root or home directory, not in `notebooks/`; and after `pre-run.sh` is executed, jupyter lab is run immediately which is in the same directory where `pre-run.sh` leave us with. (Once you are inside home directory with jupyter lab, you can't access `/notebooks/` nor `/storage/` but only home directory. This is how I understand it so far #question )
- What does `ctrl + z` do? it stops the program which is currently running and put it in the background [26:35](https://youtu.be/gdsa2VawOeM?t=1595)
- How to check what is running in the background? `jobs`
- When you are ready to get back to work on the program in the background, can you call it into the foreground? yes with `fg`
- Can you open multiple programs or `vim fileNames` and put them all in the background? yes and you can see them with `jobs` and use `fg 1` and `fg 2` to access each of them


#### Why use `pushd ~ ; popd;` in `pre-run.sh` script
- [28:45](https://youtu.be/gdsa2VawOeM?t=1725) What is the solution to the file disappearing problem? by remembering the starting directory which is always `/notebooks/` and go back to it at the end of the execution of `pre-run.sh`

	#!/usr/bin/env bash
	pushd ~
	rm -rf .local
	ln -s /storage/cfg/.local
