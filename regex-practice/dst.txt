#### [44:33](https://youtu.be/htiNBPxcXgo?t=2673) So far we have looked at what goes in as inputs and what goes out of a model as outputs. We have also looked at the middle as matrix multiplication. What are convolution (a particular kind of matrix multiplication in the middel)? How is it be very useful to CV? Why MNIST is one of the most famous CV dataset? How does Jeremy apply what Fergus and Zeiler's paper onto MNIST using excel and convolution? 

#### [49:22](https://youtu.be/htiNBPxcXgo?t=2962) How to understand convolution? What does a filter do and How does it help to detect horizontal and vertical edges? How to determine the size of the filter or kernel (3x3, or 5x5, or any)? conv1 means the first convolutional layer

#### [54:48](https://youtu.be/htiNBPxcXgo?t=3288) moving onto the second convolutional layer. Two filters give us two channels on the first convolutional layer. On the second convolutional layer, we create one 3D matrix filter which has two matrix filters to filter/process the two channels out of the first conv layer,  and condense the value. And we can also create a second channle for the 2nd conv layer using another 3D filter.

#### [1:00:48](https://youtu.be/htiNBPxcXgo?t=3648) How we do convolution slightly differently today? What is stride-two convolution and how does it work? (no more maxpooling) Then we do a lot of stride-two convolutions until the size shrinked to 7x7 and then do a average_pooling (no more dense layer). What does the 7x7 grid and take an average mean? What is the problem of such approach? When is the good time to use maxpool instead? How fastai made it easy for us to try both pooling by inventing a technique called concat_pooling to maxpool and average_pool and concat them together?  

#### [1:05:12](https://youtu.be/htiNBPxcXgo?t=3912) How to understand convolution in terms of matrix multiplications?

#### [1:20:41](https://youtu.be/htiNBPxcXgo?t=4841) Jeremy AMA: 
#### How to keep up? To keep up by focusing in subfield of deep learning and focusing on things that don't change much as the foundations of fastai have not changed much from 5 years ago. Everything else is just tweaks.

#### Will huge dataset and GPU computation replace us with small dataset and one gpu? There is always smarter ways of doing things, eg. Fastai team trained on imagenet on standard GPU faster than all companies with huge amount of GPUs. Pick areas of different domains which smaller models can beat the state of the art.
